<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm VPZ</h1>
<h3 align="center">
  Theoretically illiterate but practically pro, tech agnostic engineer from India.
  I build software for desktop, mobile, web, cars, games or anything you could fiddle with.
  In my free time, I like to spend time tinkering with embedded chips and try not to fry them.
